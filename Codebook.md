## Codebook - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project - UCI HAR Dataset 

Each variable in this dataset is a mean grouped by Activity and Subject calculated from the original data, a description of which can be found here: [UCI HAR Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/).

The original data is made up of 50Hz signals from components of Samsung phones, a selection of variables containing Fast Fourier Transform results (FFT) of the raw data, and a selection of variables produced by other calculations. The original data set contained 561 variables. For more information, see the link above.

A large number of different statistics were included in the original data.  From this, only means and standard deviations were kept and used for processing. The variable naming is consistent, i.e.:
* Acc - from the accelerometer
* Gyro - from the gyroscope
* Body - a body acceleration signal
* Gravity - a gravity acceleration signal
* Jerk - dervied from body linear acceleration and angular velocity
* Mag - the magnitude of the three-dimensional signals, calculated using the Euclidean norm 
* 't' prefix denotes time
* 'f' prefix denotes FFT

### Complete list of remaining variables:
* Subject - The volunteer/subject from which the readings were taken
* Activity - The activity of the subject at the time of reading:
	+ SITTING
	+ STANDING
	+ LAYING
	+ WALKING
	+ WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	+ WALKING_UPSTAIRS
